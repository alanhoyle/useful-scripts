# useful-scripts

These are some scripts that I like to have on multiple machines.  


* brew-update: Runs my standard homebrew updates and tells me when the last time that happened.
* brew-reset: Resets the brew git repo and runs a brew update.
* crontab-backup: Backs up the current user's crontab to a file and replaces the crontab with a note saying how to restore it.  Used when we have scheduled maintenance and need to disable automated processes.
